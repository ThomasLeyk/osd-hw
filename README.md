# Open SoC Debug Hardware Reference Implementation

This repository contains the reference implementation of the Open SoC Debug hardware components (i.e. the parts of OSD integrated into a chip).
It's written mainly in SystemVerilog with extension points towards the RISC-V Rocket core written in Chisel.

## Documentation
- The [Open SoC Debug specification](http://opensocdebug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02_spec/index.html) contains the specification this hardware implementation adheres to.
- The [Implementation Documentation](http://opensocdebug.readthedocs.io/projects/osd-hw/) describes the implementation and integration issues in more detail.

## License
The hardware code is licensed under the SolderPad license, a permissive license similar to the Apache 2 license, but adopted for the specialties of licensing digital hardware.
The Python/cocotb test code is licensed under the MIT license.
